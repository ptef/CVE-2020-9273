# CVE-2020-9273
Some files created during analysis of ProFTPd vulnerability.

I developed a local exploit, however since didn't find a memory leak some address have to be brute-forced.

This vulnerability turned out to be difficult to exploit remotely. Please read the write-up in poc-not-really.c file before trying to run `exploit.c`.
